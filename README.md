# Welcome to Pixalate ðŸŽ®
Pixalate is a personal project I created to explore game store functionalities, utilizing React, Tailwind CSS, React Router, React Slick and integrating with the RAWG Video Games Database API. It provides a platform for browsing and shopping for games, featuring a home page, store, game page, and shopping cart.
